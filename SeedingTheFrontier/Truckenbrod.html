            <!-- Artist Work and Biography -->
             <p>"My images are the site of paradox. Beauty on the surface is pitted by the turmoil underneath that bubbles up serendipitously through the thin surface of the image. This work originates on the other side of the mask, like looking out through the car windshield on a dark rainy night. The world outside is transformed through the streaks of rain."<br>
                -Joan Truckenbrod<br>
                <br>
                Joan Truckenbrod's artworks are a beautifully surreal and immersive integration of art, nature and technology that shows us a closer glimpse into subtle natural phenomena, and skillfully translates cosmic, ethereal concepts to us in a way we can appreciate. Joan is one of the earliest pioneers of digital art in the 1960's, combining artisan creation with the electronic imagery of video.<br>
                <br>
                An essential aspect of her artwork is making things by hand. In 'Objectification' you can see her themes at work. When expressing the deepest emotions of humanity and the formulaic nature of technology, the emotional message can sometimes get lost in translation. But these works use the two to complement each other impeccably, connect us with natural surroundings, and take us to surreal places far beyond the self.<><></p>
