            <!-- Artist Work and Biography -->
             <p>In our day-to-day symbiosis with technology, one can easily forget about the raw nature that shaped these gifts. Thankfully, we have those who choose to welcome nature into the space of technology, allowing both to grow. Gillerman dedicates herself to her craft as a careful observer, and a student of change. From her capturing of volcanic lava flows to her creation of an interactive solar eclipse, she translates natural earthly phenomena into grounded interactions that, even in their larger than life forms, feel utterly and honestly human.<br>
                <br>
                Her works combine sculptural elements, light, and digital imagery to create engaging and interactive exhibits, installations, video and images. Her interactive integration of nature into her art experiences are part of what makes Jody incredible. She travels the world producing works that capture change, and uses.
                <br>
                this change as a medium of its own.</p>
