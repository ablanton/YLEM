            <!-- Artist Work and Biography -->
             <p>Frank Pietronigro is what's known as an 'Artronaut' or an artist who uses space as their canvas. As truly invaluable asset to the art and technology community, Frank was the first American artist to create "drift paintings" where in a zero gravity space he would float weightlessly within a three dimensional moving painting, transcending the canvas and painting untethered to gravity aboard NASA's KC135 Turbojet (Vomit Comet). Frank used gravity as a medium and innovated the sensory experience that connects us to art.<br>
                <br>
                He is a pioneer, and a dedicated guide of art and technology's growing relationship. His dedicated originality is changing the way people see the medium, and will leave a lasting echo of inspiration for times to come.</p>
