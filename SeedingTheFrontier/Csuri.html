            <!-- Artist Work and Biography -->
             <p>Charles Csuri (1922-2022), widely recognized as “The Father of Digital Art and Computer Animation” (Smithsonian Magazine, 1995; ARTnews, 2022), was a pioneering figure whose groundbreaking work profoundly shaped the landscape of digital art. An accomplished professor, fine artist, and computer scientist, Csuri was instrumental in developing innovative software tools that would later revolutionize 3D computer graphics, animation, gaming, and 3D printing long before their widespread commercial adoption.</p>

                <p>Beginning in the 1960s, Csuri tirelessly explored the potential of computer-based multimedia, utilizing diverse technologies including plotters, canvas and screen prints, milling machine sculptures, holograms, animations, and, in his later years, NFTs. His visionary art not only tracked but significantly propelled the progress of the digital art movement, marking pivotal moments in the intersection of creativity, art, and computational technology.</p>
                
                <p>Continuing to create groundbreaking art up until the age of 99, Csuri embodied the spirit of a true renaissance figure—athlete, educator, artist, and innovator. His legacy endures in the global recognition he received for seamlessly merging art, science, and technology, influencing generations of artists and setting the stage for the digital revolution in contemporary art.</p>
