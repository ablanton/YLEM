            <!-- Artist Work and Biography -->
            <p>Beverly Kleiber (also known as Beverly Reiser) stands as a trailblazer in the world of digital and interactive art, renowned for her ability to fuse art and technology in ways that have continually expanded the boundaries of creative expression. As one of the earliest pioneers of cyber art in the 1980s, Kleiber was among the few, and even fewer women, who recognized the artistic potential of computers at a time when digital technology was still in its infancy.</p>

            <p>Her journey began with the Commodore Amiga, sparking a lifelong exploration of how technology could deepen and challenge our understanding of what it means to be human.</p>
            <p>Rooted in a strong foundation of traditional art—shaped by her grandfather Hans Norbert Kleiber, her studies with Corita Kent, and her training in Chinese brush painting with Shou-Jang Hsieh—Kleiber brought the aesthetics of stained glass and neon sculpture into the digital realm. Notably, her large-scale stained-glass window, Birth, Growth, and Return, is set for permanent installation at Enso Village, a community built by the San Francisco Zen Center.</p>
            <p>Kleiber’s pioneering spirit flourished in the 1990s and early 2000s, as she co-developed interactive video installations that explored decision-making, such as Come Human, Spin in my Web, where participants navigated an AI’s persona, and the CD-ROM Voice Garden: Labyrinth of Love, Labyrinth of Desire, which wove interactive narratives around themes of love and desire. Her work at Burning Man (2000, 2004, 2005) and immersive installations like Vital Journey / Virtual Heart at Exploration Place in Kansas showcased her commitment to making technology a vehicle for public engagement and wonder.</p>
            <p>A visionary leader, Kleiber served as president of YLEM/Artists Using Science and Technology for 14 years, curating exhibitions and fostering dialogue between artists, scientists, and technologists. Her memoir, published by Leonardo Journal (MIT Press), documents this vibrant intersection of art and science in the 1990s.</p>
            <p>Reflecting on her legacy, Kleiber remarked, "I find it deliciously curious that my legacy will be the electronic art that I’ve created, and that one of my last collections: 'Zoomhallucinations reaches into the past to become new again.' Ever a playful instigator and a pioneer at the cusp of new paradigms, Beverly Kleiber’s work continues to inspire artists at the intersection of art, science, and technology."</p>
