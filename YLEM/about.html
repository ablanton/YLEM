    <h3>The Evolution of Art at the Intersection of Science and New Technologies: The 1990s and the Legacy of Ylem</h3>
    <p class="paragraph">
      The 1990s represented a pivotal moment in the development of digital media art. With the rapid proliferation of personal computing, multimedia authoring tools, and networked communication, artists found themselves at the threshold of an era that enabled new relationships between creator, audience, and machine. Nowhere was this more evident than in the community surrounding <b>Ylem: Artists Using Science & Technology</b>, a collective founded in the late 1980s in the San Francisco Bay Area that flourished in the 1990s. Ylem functioned as a dynamic nexus where artists, scientists, technologists, and thinkers gathered to explore the creative potential of emerging technologies. The organization offered not only a platform for exhibiting experimental work, but also served as an intellectual incubator for interdisciplinary collaboration during a decade that would shape the trajectory of media art for years to come.</p>

      <p class="paragraph"><b>Trudy Myrrh Regan</b> is an artist known for her work exploring the possibilities of collaboration between artists and scientists, most notably through her involvement with the group Ylem: Artists Using Science and Technology which she founded in 1986 and procured for the group 501c3 status.</p>

      <p class="paragraph"><b>Gary Zellerbach</b> was a holographer and founding member of Ylem. He played a pivotal role in shaping the group's mission to connect artists, especially 
      those pushing the boundaries of holography.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">Ylem’s name itself, borrowed from a term in cosmology referring to the primordial substance of the Big Bang, signaled its commitment to exploring the origins and evolution of creative expression through the lens of science. Its membership included a wide array of pioneers in digital media, many of whom engaged deeply with themes of interactivity and narration. Their work exemplified the ethos of Ylem: integrating technological inquiry with humanist concerns to produce art that was not only experimental in form but resonant in content.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">Among these, <b>Beverly Kleiber</b> aka <b>Reiser</b> emerged as a key figure in interactive installations—often immersive and user-responsive—reflected a profound interest in memory, identity, and perception. Using CD-ROM technology and early interactive video platforms, Kleiber aka Reiser developed nonlinear storytelling environments that placed the viewer at the center of a shifting, fragmented narrative.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">The 1990s also saw contributions from figures whose work intersected with the scientific and technological dimensions of art in diverse ways. <b>Louis Brill</b>, a media writer and consultant, chronicled and contextualized much of the emerging digital art scene, helping to frame its discourse.</p>

      <p class="paragraph"><b>Larry Harvey</b>, <b>founder of Burning Man</b>, fostered a large-scale community that, while not strictly digital, embodied the same experimental and interdisciplinary spirit that Ylem artists championed. Harvey’s temporary city in the Nevada desert became a proving ground for installations that often fused low and high technology, and where narrative, ritual, and media experimentation found fertile ground.

      <p class="paragraph">Artists like <b>Jim Pallas</b> brought interactivity into public space. Known for his electronic sculptures, Pallas created works that sensed and responded to their viewers, challenging the traditional boundaries between art objects and spectators. His “electronic social sculptures” presaged later developments in responsive environments and participatory media.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Similarly, <b>Joan Truckenbrod</b>, a pioneer in algorithmic and computer-generated art, was among the first to explore how code could be used to create gestural, abstract visual forms. Truckenbrod’s work bridged handcraft and computation, revealing the poetic potential of algorithmic processes.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Another important figure in this constellation was <b>Roman Verostko</b>, whose transition from traditional painting to algorithmic drawing reflected the profound changes taking place in art practice. Verostko’s plotter drawings, created with software he personally wrote, raised important questions about authorship, creativity, and the role of the artist in a mediated process. His work, like that of many Ylem-affiliated artists, remained grounded in a deep philosophical inquiry, reflecting on the machine not as a cold, mechanical tool, but as an expressive collaborator.</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><b>Roger Malina</b>, both a physicist and executive editor of <i>Leonardo</i>, played a crucial role in facilitating dialogue between artists and scientists during this time. Through his editorial work and his own advocacy, Malina helped elevate the discourse surrounding art and technology, situating media art within broader cultural and scientific conversations. His emphasis on a transdisciplinary approach echoed Ylem’s founding ethos, and his support helped bridge the gap between artistic innovation and academic recognition.</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><b>Frank Pietronegro</b>, an artist known for his work with zero gravity performance and spatial media, also contributed to expanding the boundaries of what art could mean in an age of technological transformation. His “drift paintings,” created during parabolic flight, offered new perspectives on embodiment, space, and materiality. Like many of his Ylem peers, Pietronegro’s work engaged both scientific inquiry and poetic gesture, demonstrating how technology could enable entirely new modes of expression.</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><b>Fred Stitt</b>, revolutionary organic architect, sheltered our fledgeling</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><b>Communications media</b> - newsletters and Directories back in the day when everything was on paper and a database was out of the ordinary. We even had mail-bundleling parties. Not to mention, the Ylem Halloween parties at his house with characters worthy of a bar scene in Star Wars</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><b>Trudy Myrrh Regan</b> is an artist known for her work exploring the possibilities of collaboration between artists and scientists, most notably through her involvement with the group Ylem: Artists Using Science and Technology which she founded in 1986 procuring for the group 501c3 status. Trudy is a Quaker. She embodies their values of simplicity, integrity and equality.</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><b>Gary Zellerbach</b> is a holographer and founding member of Ylem. He played a pivotal role in shaping the group's mission to connect artists, especially those pushing the aesthetic boundaries of holography.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Together, these artists and thinkers created a fertile ecosystem in which the boundaries between disciplines dissolved. Ylem’s role in fostering this community was both practical and visionary. Through exhibitions, newsletters, public panels, and collaborations with institutions like SIGGRAPH and <i>The Leonardo Journal</i>, the organization provided critical infrastructure for a generation of artists working outside the traditional gallery system. In doing so, it helped legitimize experimental practices that would later become central to digital and new media art.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">By the end of the 1990s, many of the themes first explored by Ylem artists—interactivity, hybridity, algorithmic logic, and embodied engagement—had entered the mainstream of artistic production. Museums began incorporating digital works into their collections, and universities established programs in media arts and interactive design. Yet the experimental ethos that characterized Ylem remained: commitment to inquiry, play, and cross-disciplinary exchange that resisted easy commodification.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">In retrospect, the 1990s can be seen as a seedbed not only for digital media art but for a broader redefinition of what art could be in a networked, data-driven world. The contributions of the artists mentioned above continue to resonate, not only for their technical innovation but for their vision of art as a space where technology and humanity could meet in dialogue—curious, open-ended, and ever-evolving.</p>
