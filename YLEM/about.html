      Ylem/Artists Using Science & Technology was grassroots networking organization of artists and art lovers who looked to science and tech- nology for ideas and inspiration. The word “Ylem” is the Greek word for the exploding primordial mass from which the universe emerged. We believed in the power of ideas to take form as art, spread and transfig- ure human civilization.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">With a concentration of talent on the frontier of emerging art forms, Ylem was committed to promoting its members' art to the art, science and technology communities and the general public. Ylem’s diverse membership includes artists working in high technology accompanied by an assortment of science and technology enthusiasts.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">The ideas generated by the marriage of art and science were explored in Ylem’s monthly newsletter, later named The Ylem Journal and at the bi-monthly forums hosted by the San Francisco Exploratorium. Each of these had either guest editors or moderators presenting their highly idiosyncratic, trail-blazing brainchildren. They included personalities as remarkable as Leonard Shlain, Larry Harvey, Roman Verostko, Jody Gillerman, Joeg Bullock, and Sylia Pengilly.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">The Newsletter/Journal was printed for 28 years. The yearly Directory, originally called The Ylem Yellow Pages, published the work of over 200 artists annually. Trudy Myrrh Reagan founded Ylem in 1985 and it was granted 501c3 status.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Ylem president Beverly Reiser (1985 to 1999) kept a mobile slide carousel available for presentation at galleries, symposiums and varied events to show curators the possibilities within the nascent art realm that awaited them. She worked closely with Roger Malina, the head of The International Society for the Arts, Science & Technology to keep these works in the public eye. As a step towards augmenting each other’s efforts Beverly was chair of the ISAST Advisory Board and Roger was on the Ylem Advisory Board.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Louis Brill was a bridge between Ylem, Burning Man and Leonardo. For many years Ylem’s publications were run through the offices of the highly experimental architect Fred Stitt.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">At the end of the day, I think it would be safe to say that our kindred-spirit gatherings and projects were supportive, inspirational, informative, explorative and a celebration of the human spirit at its adventuresome best.</p>
