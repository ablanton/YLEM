    <b>SELF EXPRESSION ON THE BLEEDING EDGE</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    Lucia Grossberger Morales is an interactive computer artist. Born in Bolivia, Lucia emigrated to
    the US as a young girl. Her works are visually rich, often reflecting her personal history, Bolivian
    politics, and Latino and indigenous cultures - particularly through shrines, ritual, fabric, and
    anthropology.
    <br>
    <br>
    According to Anna Couey, in a 1995 conversation with Grossberger Morales (Couey 1995), “It's
    hard to describe the impact of Lucia's work: a Dia de los Muertos shrine installation with
    candles, marigolds, Bolivian fabric surrounding an almost psychedelic computer screen inviting
    you to interact. Scanned weavings depicting animals - you move the mouse over an animal, and
    it moves. An older work, HyperCard, in Spanish and English, about leaving the Bolivian
    mountains/coming to US cities with tall buildings. Powerful, playful, physical - not electronic art
    divorced from the body or the spirit”.

    At first as she attempted to integrate her cultural roots with the computer, the discomfort was
    there - but as the years went by, the two just exist together, very comfortably. I feel that it was
    fortunate that I kept the computer. The computer is not inherent in any culture and is an
    incredible tool for allowing people to express their own cultures.
    <br>
    <br>
    In Bolivia I was consulting at the Children's Museum. I had created some animations which
    incorporated some current weavings of the area and some of the animated some of the
    characters on those weavings. A group of about forty kids came to see the animation. Of course
    I didn't have to give them instructions, they were all pretty computer savvy. Afterwards an eight-
    year-old girl said to me, "I didn't know that you could do that." I wasn't sure what she meant,

    but finally what came out was that she didn't know that it was possible to have her culture
    represented on the computer.
