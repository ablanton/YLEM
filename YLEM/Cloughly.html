    Will Cloughley’s (1938 - 1929) visual language is profoundly shaped by his enduring fascination with archaeology,
cosmology, and mysticism. These three pillars have guided his hand, mind, and eye, informing not
only the tenor of his imagery but also the meditative intent that underpins his creative practice.
Through them, Cloughley has constructed an artistic vocabulary that weaves together the symbols of
ancient humanity, the architectures of the cosmos, and the searching spirit of the mystic, yielding
works that are at once rooted in primordial memory and oriented toward future horizons.

  Cloughley’s engagement with archaeology is manifest both in the materials he favours and in the
layered sensibilities of his compositions. Like a patient excavator, each mark he makes upon the
paper is an act of discovery—his pen and ink drawings often possessing the patina of age, as if they
were fragments recovered from some buried, forgotten civilization. Motifs reminiscent of ancient cave
markings, enigmatic runes, and fossilized relics are recalled through his deft use of line and shadow.
Themes of deep time and cultural memory pervade his work, suggesting that every gesture is, in itself,
both record and relic—a testament to the continuous interplay between past and present. In his
celebrated artist’s books, such as “Red Rock, Black Sun,” Cloughley invokes mythic journeys across
rugged landscapes, aligning the journey of the individual with the collective memory embedded in
stone, earth, and sun.
    <br><br>
    Equally evident is Cloughley’s preoccupation with cosmology, that grand inquiry into the nature and
origins of the universe. His drawings frequently echo the geometries and harmonics of the cosmos:
swirling primordial forms, fractal architectures, and celestial orbs populate his compositions. These are
not mere decorative allusions, but rather visual meditations on order and chaos, unity and
fragmentation. There is, within his work, an intimation of the cosmos as both map and mythological
space, wherein each image becomes a portal to contemplation—the microcosm reflecting the
macrocosm, and vice versa. Through this, Cloughley bridges the divide between the known and the
unknown, beckoning viewers into r ealms where science and myth intersect and cohere.
    <br><br>
    The final refrain in Cloughley’s triad of influences is his deep and abiding interest in mysticism. The
presence of hand-drawn symbols, coded gestures, and spiritual forms suffuses his work with
numinous resonance. Nowhere is this more evident than in his ambitious “Digital Mudra” project,
wherein the sacred hand gestures of disparate cultures—traditionally used for healing, invocation, and
communication—are meticulously catalogued, redrawn, and digitally translated. In this endeavor,
Cloughley simultaneously honours the embodied wisdom of the hand and reveals the ways in which
technology can act as a conduit for the transmission and transformation of spiritual knowledge. Each

mudra, in his rendering, becomes a bridge not merely between cultures, but between the ancient and
the emergent, the material and the numinous.
    <br><br>
   In synthesis, these influences yield a body of work that is contemplative, multi-layered, and
symbolically rich. For Cloughley, every drawing is not only a product of the hand, but a meditation
upon the act of .
    <br><br>
    creation itself—a means by which the artist becomes both archaeologist and cosmologist, uncovering
the hidden harmonies that bind humanity to earth, sky, and spirit. His practice does not seek to draw
strict boundaries between tradition and innovation, but rather to dwell in the fertile space where they
commingle. Through such a dialectic, Cloughley’s visual language emerges as a living testament to
art’s capacity to seek meaning: connecting the visible with the invisible, the past with the possible, and
the solitary gesture of the hand with the boundless measure of the stars.
    <br><br>
    In addition to these formative strands, Cloughley’s oeuvre finds a compelling and enigmatic
expression in the project titled “A.I.G.I. Joe”. Here, Cloughley deftly engages with the iconography of
popular culture, reimagining the well-known figure of G.I. Joe through a lens that is both critical and
visionary. In works such as the “A.I.G.I. Joe Life Force Cyborg” multi-image shows, he blends
traditional hand-rendered drawing with digital compositing—employing the motif of the cyborg to probe
the eroding boundaries between the organic and the synthetic, the heroic and the programmed. The
A.I.G.I. Joe becomes, under his hand, less a soldier of conventional conflict and more an avatar for
the technological transformation of identity: each composition is layered with visual codes that evoke
questions of agency, memory, and the persistence of myth under the sign of machine intelligence.
Through this series, Cloughley extends his meditation on archaeology and mysticism into the
mythology of the twenty-first century, using the familiar forms of childhood battle play as a vehicle for
exploring the evolving relationship between art, technology, and the deeper symbolic forces that
shape human destiny.
