    Detroit Art Critic, Joy Colby once described Pallas as having the “tinkering genius of Henry Ford
    combined with the ironic wit of Marcel Duchamp.”

    <br>
    Artist and sculptor Jim Pallas is known for creating surrealistic, electro-kinetic sculptures that
    provoke the senses and spark curiosity. In Siren Heart, the industrially cryptic looking structure
    senses ambient temperature, sounds, conversation and the movement of warm bodies.The use
    of recycled materials like hair dryers, bone cutting knives, and World War II air raid sirens
    exemplify a well balanced dichotomy of old and new, shown in the signature surreal fashion that
    only Jim could produce. He is not afraid to be weird, and not afraid to experiment. While other
    components like the hair dryers have acute responses to temperature and sound, the air raid
    siren only goes off once a year.

    In this way, it is listening very carefully at all times. One of the things that makes Jim Pallas unique is that in his work involving art and technology,
    there is focus on interactive conversation. It would be exciting to see this explored further.
    <br>
    <br>
    Thank you Jim for your inventive, wonderfully weird style of thought, we look forward to what's in
    store for the future.
