       Ylem/Artists Using Science & Technology was a grassroots 
       networking organization of artists and art lovers who looked to 
       science and technology for ideas and inspiration. The word “Ylem”
       is the Greek word for the exploding primordial mass from which
       the universe emerged. We believed in the power of ideas to take
       form as art, spread and transfigure human civilization. 
       With a concentration of talent on the frontier of emerging art forms,
       Ylem was committed to promoting its members' art to the art, science 
       and technology communities and the general public. Ylem&#39;s diverse 
       membership includes artists working in high technology accompanied by
       an assortment of science and technology enthusiasts.
       The ideas generated by the marriage of art and science
       were explored in Ylem&#39;s monthly newsletter, later named 
       The Ylem Journal and at the bi-monthly forums hosted by Larry Shaw at
       San Francisco&#39;s Exploratorium. Each of these events had either guest 
       editors or moderators presenting their highly idiosyncratic,
       trail-blazing brainchildren. They included personalities as remarkable
       as Leonard Shlain, Larry Harvey, Roman Verostko, Jody Gillerman,
       Joeg Bullock, and Sylia Pengilly. The Newsletter/Journal was printed
       for 28 years. The yearly Directory, originally called The Ylem Yellow Pages,
       published the work of over 200 artists annually.
       Trudy Myrrh Reagan founded Ylem in 1985 and it was granted 501c3
       status.
       Ylem president Beverly Reiser (1985 to 1999) kept a mobile slide carousel
       available for presentation at galleries, symposiums and varied events to
       show curators the possibility that a nascent art realm awaited them.
       She worked closely with Roger Malina, the head of The International
       Society for the Arts, Science & Technology to keep these works in the 
       public eye. As a step towards augmenting each other&#39;s efforts Beverly
       was chair of the ISAST Advisory Board and Roger was on the Ylem Advisory
       Board. 
       Louis Brill was a bridge between Ylem, Burning Man and Leonardo. For
       many years Ylem&#39;s publications were run through the offices of the highly
       experimental architect Fred Stitt.
       At the end of the day, I think it would be safe to say that our kindred-spirit
       gatherings and projects were supportive, inspirational, informative,
       explorative and a celebration of the human spirit at its adventuresome best.
