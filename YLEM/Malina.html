    <b>Pathbreaking is a desirable human activity:</b><br>
    <b>YLEM to EUVE to Emerging Neo- Phenomena</b><br>
    <b>Roger F Malina Oct 13, 2024</b>
    <br><br>
    Humans inherently are explorers and discoverers and, unfortunately, often colonizers. When I arrived at UC Berkeley in 1982, YLEM: Artists Using Science and Technology non-profit group in the San Francisco Bay Area had been activating since 1981. I became friends with the YLEM team and in particular Bev Riser (AKA Kleiber) and Louis Brill, one of the cofounders of the Burning Man festival when it moved to. Brill was pioneering virtual reality art using holography.
    <br><br>
    YLEM’s website: www.ylem.org. Public YLEM Forums introduced artists to science, scientists to art and the general public to new artistic and technological expression.
    <br><br>
    At the time this was strange. Artists, scientists and the public rarely ate together. My father, Frank J. Malina, had started, in 1968, the Journal Leonardo as a nexus for the arts, sciences and technology. YLEM was in its footsteps. My father died in 1981; the year YLEM was born. 
    <br><br>
    So, I connected Leonardo to YLEM and the rest is storytelling (not history, as YLEM was a mixture of genders from its inception).
    <br><br>
    YLEM staged field trips to laboratories, industrial sites and artists' studios and mounted exhibitions of members' work. Members made fast friends who encouraged each other’s work in this new arena.
    <br><br>
    While at Berkeley I became involved in a NASA satellite project called EUVE. IT also was exploring new territory, as was YLEM.
    <br><br>
    The Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE) was a NASA astronomy mission operating in the relatively unexplored extreme ultraviolet (70-760 Å) band. EUVE was strange because it explored and successfully mapped a part of the local electromagnetic spectrum that had been largely inaccessible before. The science payload was designed and built at the Space Sciences Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley. I, Roger Malina, was responsible for overseeing the design and construction of the EUVE science payload.  The science payload was attached to a Multi-Mission Modular spacecraft that was launched on a Delta II Rocket from cape Canaveral on June 7, 1992. It performed its last all sky survey on January 21, 1993, and then probed deeper and deeper as YLEM and Leonardo did.
    <br><br>
    YLEM AND EUVE's Lasting Legacies
    <br><br>
    YLEM’s groundbreaking work mapped the new artistic territory that combined art and technology (often known as computer graphics at the time).
    <br><br>
    EUVE and YLEM’s groundbreaking work in mapping the extremes in our arts scientific community provided a comprehensive view of the local physical and intellectual universe in a previously unexplored wavelength range of comprehension. 
    <br><br>
    The Tom Linehan exhibition in 2024 weaves together several territories. Linehan was a student of Chuck Csuri, a pioneer of computer graphics (AKA art, science and technology). Linehan triggered the emergence of the UT Dallas program in Art Technology and Emerging Communication which is why I came to Dallas (at Linehan’s triggering). Linehan met Leonardo and Ylem members at the SIGGRAPH conferences and all three joined at the intellectual and artistic hips from then onwads.

    Comment from Christine Malina (who watched the rocket launch from a few miles away, with our three small children sitting on the ‘white bleachers’ at Cape Canaveral that June day, over 34 years ago.  “I had always dreamed about getting the chance to watch a rocket launch from Cape Canaveral – never in my wildest dreams did I expect to find myself there, being able to communicate with the ‘man in charge’ of the payload being launched –   It was indeed a dream come true! For months after the launch, our 2 ½ year-old son would get up in the morning and rewatch the rocket launch video, proclaiming: “fire! smoke! Daddy’s rocket!”.
